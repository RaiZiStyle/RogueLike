# Idea 

## Map design
- Make the map of my old familial house
- Hide madelenne de prouste stuff everywhere
- Make the garden as well (later)
- 

## Game design
- Make doors lock && lockable
- Add random to the hallway 
    > By making a switch case of range from one to 10, and make the x move if rand is between 1 to 7). Not sure it will work tho

### Abbility
- Lockpicking
